# Portfolio website

My personal website used to showcase my full-stack development skills and projects that I've built so far. It includes links to the live projects and GitHub repos, a contact page with info and a form to submit queries, and other details.
Design was inspired the web pages of the 90s and 00s, a time where creavity and self-expression were more common on the web.
