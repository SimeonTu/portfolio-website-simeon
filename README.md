# Portfolio website

## Overview

My personal website serving as a digital representation of one's professional identity. It includes a page for my full-stack development skills, a page for projects that I've built so far, including links to each project's live page and GitHub repo, a contact page with info and a form to submit queries. Design was inspired the web pages of the 90s and 00s, a time where creavity and self-expression were more common on the web.
